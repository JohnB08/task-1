          He was sold as a Mauremys Reevesii turtle, <br />
          yet close scrutiny has shown he's actually a Mauremys Sinesis. <br />
          He is supposedly 4 years old, yet his size does tell me he might be
          older. <br />
          These facts have no bearing on his day to day existence, however. He
          is still just a lazy turtle.
